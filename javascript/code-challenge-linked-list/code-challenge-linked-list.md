# Singly Linked List

Build a `linked list` that can detecte if there is a `head node` or not if not it will create one if there is a `head node` it will create a new node next to the head it called `tail node` and I can test if there is a `specific` value in the nodes or not.

## Challenge

- [x]Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list.

- [x]Can properly insert into the linked list.

- [x]The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.

- [x]Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.

- [x]Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists.

- [x]Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist.

- [x]Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list.

## Approach & Efficiency

`big O(n)`
