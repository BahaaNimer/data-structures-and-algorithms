# Hashmap LEFT JOIN

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

Implement a simplified LEFT JOIN for 2 Hashmaps

## Challenge

<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

Write a function called left join >>> Arguments: two hash maps

The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.

The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.

Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
